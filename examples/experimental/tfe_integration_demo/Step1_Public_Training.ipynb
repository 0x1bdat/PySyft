    "Welcome to this tutorial! In the following notebooks you will learn how to provide private predictions. By private predictions, we mean that the data is constantly encrypted throughout the entire process. At no point is the user sharing raw data, only encrypted data. In order to provide these private predictions, Syft Keras uses a library called [TF Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted) under the hood. TF Encrypted combines cutting-edge cryptographic and machine learning techniques. You don't have to worry about the cryptographic part. TF-Encrypted takes care of everything, so you can focus on the machine learning component. \n",

    "You can start serving private predictions with only three steps:\n",
    "- **Step 1**: train your model with normal Keras.\n",
    "- **Step 2**: secure and serve your machine learning model (server).\n",
    "- **Step 3**: querry the secured model to receive private predictions (client). \n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's go through these three steps so you can deploy impactful machine learning services while preserving the user's privacy."

    "To use privacy-preserving machine learning techniques for your projects you shouldn't have to learn a new machine learning framework. With Syft Keras, if you have basic [Keras](https://keras.io/) knowledge you can start using these techniques in no time. If you have never used Keras before, you can go through [this tutorial](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted/blob/master/bin/serve). \n",
