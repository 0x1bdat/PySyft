    "### Context \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is the driver behind Machine Learning. Companies, organisations or hospitals that create and collect data are able to build and train their own machine learning models in house. This allows them to offer it as a service (MLaaS) to outside collaborators which don't have access to as much data but would like to benefit from this model to gain insights on their own data. This data might be extremely sensitive (think about you sending a picture of your skin to detect skin cancer) and can't be sent in clear to a server. In return, it is likely that the model is also too critical from a business perspective to be sent directly to the client who could potentially steal it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, one possible solution is to encrypt both the model and the data and to perform the machine learning prediction in a completely encrypted setting. Several encryption schemes exist that allow for computation over encrypted data, among which Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), Homomorphic Encryption (FHE/SHE) and Functional Encryption (FE). We will focus here on Multi-Party Computation (which have been introduced in Tutorial 5) which consists of private additive sharing and relies on the crypto protocols SecureNN and SPDZ, the details of which are given [in this excellent blog post](https://mortendahl.github.io/2017/09/03/the-spdz-protocol-part1/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact setting in this tutorial is the following: consider that you are the server and you have some data. First, you define and train a model with this data. Second, you get in touch with a client which holds some data and would like to access your model to do some prediction. It encrypts this data by building private shares while you do the same with your model, and then you execute the private evaluation of your model. Finally the result of the prediction is sent back encrypted to the client so that the server (you) learns nothing about the client's data.\n",
