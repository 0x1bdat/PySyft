    "Encryption here comes in two steps. Since Secure Multi-Party Computation only works on integers, in order to operate over numbers with decimal points (such as weights and activations), we need to encode all of our numbers using Fixed Precision, which will give us several bits of decimal precision. We do this by calling .fix_precision().\n",

    "We can then call .share() as we have for other demos, which will encrypt all of the values by sharing them between Alice and Bob. Note that we also set requires_grad to True, which also adds a special autograd method for encrypted data. Indeed, since Secure Multi-Party Computation doesn't work on float values, we can't use the usual PyTorch autograd. Therefore, we need to add a special AutogradTensor node that computes the gradient graph for backpropagation. You can print any of this element to see that it includes an AutogradTensor."
