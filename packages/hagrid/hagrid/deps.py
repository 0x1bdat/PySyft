"""The purpose of these functions is to check the local dependencies of the person running the CLI
tool and ensure that things are properly configured for the cli's full use (depending on the user's
operating system.) When dependencies are missing the CLI tool should offer helpful hints about what
course of action to take to install missing dependencies, even offering to run appropraite
installation commands where applicable."""
