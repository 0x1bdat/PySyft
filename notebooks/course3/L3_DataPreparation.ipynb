    "# Lesson 3: Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation is particularly important when doing Remote Data Science and Machine Learning. This is because the data scientist doesn't inherently have the ability to freely check how clean the data is, and whether it needs pre-processing. As such, the responsibility falls onto the Data Owner to ensure the data is clean, annotated, and usable.\n",

    "## 3.1 Data Acquisition!\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Acquisition focuses on generating and capturing data into a system. Broadly speaking, it's made up of two phases: <b> data harvesting</b>, and <b>data ingestion</b>. The former, we'll cover in this lesson, and the latter, we'll show you over the next two lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 The 4 V's of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to thinking about data, there are usually four major things to think about, commonly referred to in the industry as the 4 V's of data. They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Volume </b> refers to the quantity or amount of data in question.\n",
    "An example of low volume: if you're collecting sensitive data about people with a rare condition.\n",
    "An example of high volume would be most social media applications that you've heard of. For instance, Facebook has more users than China has people. And each of those people are making posts, uploading pictures, liking content- that adds up to trillions of photos that they can use for data science and machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Velocity </b> refers to the rate at which new data is being gathered or collected.\n",
    "For instance, if you're a company, performance reviews might only come once a quarter.\n",
    "But if you're YouTube, then in one day, you have over 700,000 hours of new videos added. For context, that's longer than the average human lifespan. So if a new person was born tomorrow, and they spent every moment of their life just trying to watch the YouTube videos uploaded on the day they were born, on average they wouldn't be able to get through them all.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Variety </b> refers to the diversity of the data that's being collected. For example, think of the difference between a dataset consisting of polls, and a dataset consisting of emails. No two emails are necessarily quite the same. They could contain quite literally, anything- text about anything, pictures of anything, attachments of any kind, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Value </b> refers to the idea that not all kinds of data are of equal value. Let's say you're collecting medical images, and some of the images were corrupted during the acquisition process, and were blurry and grainy as a result. That data isn't quite as valuable as a pristine scan."

    "<b> DID YOU KNOW? </b> A historical example of the latter point were the Geiger counters used in Chernobyl. <p>Immediately after the Chernobyl nuclear accident, many people at the time weren't too concerned because measurements from their Geiger counters showed a measurement of 3.6 Roentgen/hour- the equivalent measurement of 10 X-rays. However, it was later discovered that the Geiger counters in use had a maximum detection limit and sensitivity which meant they couldn't read any numbers higher than 3.6 R/h. When new, higher range Geiger counters were used, it was quickly (and shockingly) realized that the radiation being leaked wasn't 3.6R/h, but around 5.6 per SECOND. This was the equivalent of _ nuclear bombs worth of radiation per hour.</p>\n",
