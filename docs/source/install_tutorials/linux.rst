Linux Tutorials
***************

If you know that you're running Linux but you're not sure what version you're running,
open up a command line and type:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ lsb_release -a

Which should print something like the following:

|find_ubuntu_version|

See where this image says "20.04.3"? Figure out what number yours says in that place

#. Ubuntu (20.04.3 - Focal Fossa)
#. Older versions


.. |find_ubuntu_version| image:: ../_static/install_tutorials/find_ubuntu_version.png
