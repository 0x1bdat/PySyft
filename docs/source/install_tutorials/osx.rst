OSX Tutorial
*************

If you know you're running OSX but you're not sure what version you're running,
click the Apple logo at the top left corner, then click "About this Mac" and you'll
see something like:

|find_osx_version|

See where this image says "11.5.1"? Figure out what number yours says in that place
and use that number to determine which of these installation tutorials you should
follow to complete your installation. If you don't see your number, choose the
closest that you can.

#. Big Sur (11.5.1)
#. Older versions
