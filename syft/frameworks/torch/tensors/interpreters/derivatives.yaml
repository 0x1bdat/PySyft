# This file contains definitions for gradient functions used for backprop in 
# AutogradTensor. The definitions are read by build_gradients.py, converted to 
# GradFunc classes as strings, then written to gradients.py.
#
# Each entry consists of:
#   - A 'name', corresponding to the Tensor method you are defining the derivative for
#   - One or more gradient entries, for each of the method inputs with a gradient
#

# Other can be a Number or a Tensor and Python doesn't have multiple dispatch...
- name: add
  self: grad
  other: grad if type(self) == type(other) else None

- name: asin
  self: grad * (-self * self + 1).rsqrt()
